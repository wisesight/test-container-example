# TestContainer Examples Repository

Welcome to the TestContainer Examples Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing example code for using TestContainer in different programming languages. Our goal is to create a comprehensive resource for developers looking to integrate TestContainer into their projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized into language-specific directories:

- `go`: Contains Golang example code.
- `typescript`: Contains Typescript example code. Open for contributions!
- `python`: Contains Python example code. Open for contributions!

Each language directory includes its own README.md with specific instructions and details about the examples provided.

## How to Contribute

We're actively seeking contributions, especially in languages where we currently have limited examples. If you're proficient in a programming language and familiar with TestContainer, your contributions are greatly appreciated!

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your example code to the relevant language directory. If your language isn't currently represented, feel free to create a new directory.
3. Ensure that your code is well-documented and follows best practices.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your additions or changes.

## Support and Questions
